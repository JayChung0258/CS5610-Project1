        <h1>My Culinary Adventures</h1>
        <p>A take on my journey of cooking in the U.S. and my relentless efforts to improve – mainly in hopes of not starving.</p>

                <h2>Dumplings with a Side of Garlic & Soy Sauce Art</h2>
                <img src="../assets/images/dumpling.jpg" alt="Dumplings made by Jay" class="dish-image">
                <p>These homemade dumplings may not win any beauty contests, but they’re filled with love...and a hint of survival instinct. The garlic and soy sauce arrangement was unintentional, yet surprisingly artistic!</p>

                <h2>Stir-Fried Noodles with a Side of Steamed Broccoli</h2>
                <img src="../assets/images/stir-fry-noodles.jpg" alt="Stir-fried noodles with broccoli" class="dish-image">
                <p>A well-balanced meal featuring noodles and veggies! The broccoli might look slightly overpowered, but hey, at least it’s green. Slowly leveling up from instant noodles to actual "dishes."</p>

                <h2>Sizzling Chicken with Onions</h2>
                <img src="../assets/images/sizzling-chicken.jpg" alt="Sizzling chicken with onions" class="dish-image">
                <p>A culinary masterpiece in the making! The sizzling sound may suggest pro-level cooking, but let’s be honest, I’m still working on not overcooking the onions. Slowly transforming into a home chef…or so I hope!</p>

                <img src="../assets/images/fried-chicken.jpg" alt="Crispy fried chicken wings with Coke" class="dish-image">
                <p>Nothing says "I’m learning to cook" like homemade fried chicken! Perfectly paired with a cold Coke, this dish is my attempt to bring restaurant vibes home. Just trying to make sure I don’t set off the smoke alarm.</p>
